# Windows Forms Blog Application - Project Report
Date: May 20, 2025

## Project Overview
This Windows Forms application provides a complete blogging system with user authentication, blog post management, and administrative capabilities. The application was built using C# and Windows Forms with a SQLite database for data persistence.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- Secure login with password hashing (SHA-256)
- User registration with validation
- Session management
- Role-based permissions (admin vs. regular users)
- Logout functionality

### 2. Blog Post Management
- Create new blog posts with title, content, and category
- View existing posts with details
- Edit posts (with permission checking)
- Delete posts (with permission checking)
- Filter posts by category
- Search functionality for posts

### 3. User Management (Admin Only)
- View all user accounts
- Add new user accounts
- Edit existing user accounts
- Delete user accounts
- Assign admin privileges
- Protection for default admin account

### 4. Modern UI
- Clean, consistent design across all forms
- Color scheme with blue accent color (#007ACC)
- Responsive layout with proper sizing
- Status bar displaying current user
- Menu system for navigation
- Styled buttons and controls

## Architecture and Implementation

### Data Layer
- SQLite database with two main tables:
  - BlogPosts: Stores all blog post data
  - Users: Stores user account information
- BlogRepository class handles all database operations
- Automatic database initialization with default admin account

### Models
- BlogPost: Represents a blog post with properties like title, content, etc.
- User: Represents a user account with authentication capabilities

### Forms
- LoginForm: Handles user authentication
- RegisterForm: Allows new user registration
- MainForm: Main interface displaying blog posts with filtering
- EditPostForm: Interface for creating/editing posts
- ViewPostForm: Displays post details
- UserManagementForm: Admin interface for user management
- UserEditForm: Interface for adding/editing users

### Security Features
- Password hashing for secure storage
- Permission checking before edit/delete operations
- User role management
- Input validation to prevent errors

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Database Initialization
- Challenge: The application was failing to find the Users table during new user registration
- Solution: Added table existence checking and automatic creation of missing tables

### 2. User Authentication
- Challenge: Needed secure password storage and validation
- Solution: Implemented SHA-256 hashing for passwords and proper authentication logic

### 3. User Session Management
- Challenge: Maintaining user state across multiple forms
- Solution: Created a static CurrentUser property in Program class accessible application-wide

### 4. Permission-Based Actions
- Challenge: Limiting edit/delete operations based on user permissions
- Solution: Added checks to verify user ownership or admin status before allowing actions
